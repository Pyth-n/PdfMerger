# PdfMerger
Merges given PDF files into a new combined PDF document.

## Requirements
* [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* `pip3 install PyPDF2`

* GUI runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (with Python 3+ installed)

* Patience. This is my first GUI app with Tk (Python Tkinter)


## How To Run:
Either clone `git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:Pyth-n/PdfMerger.git`

or [download the latest release file on your system](https://github.com/Pyth-n/PdfMerger/releases) and extract it.


Make the `main.py` file **executable**. Example: `chmod +x main.py`

Then pass the `main.py` file as an argument to your Python 3 interpreter through the command-line:
`python3 main.py`


## TODO:
* Code
  * Refactor
* Features
  * Drag and Drop (no ETA, dependant on stable release through Tkinter)
  * Modify order of PDFs to export
